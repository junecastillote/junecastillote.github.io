I"Å<p>Hi. Thank you for visiting this website.</p>

<p>My name is June and I have been running this website since 2011. It started out as a simple Blogspot site where I post about the stuff I do daily as a messaging and collaboration engineer. The site has been moved from Blogspot to Wordpress.org, and the contents grew - and I‚Äôm not the only one writing posts anymore.</p>

<p>However, after losing all my blog data from the previous hosting, I decided to ditch paid hosting and moved this site to Github Pages. I am slowly rebuilding the contents from whatever old data I can dig up, and the old links that I may have shared previously no longer works.</p>
