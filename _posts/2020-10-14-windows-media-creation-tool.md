Performing repairs or reinstalling Windows has never been easier like it is today. If you're still able to access the operating system, initializing a reset will only take a few clicks, and you're done. However, suppose you're unable to access the operating system anymore.

In that case, you will need an installation media such as a USB Flash Drive or an ISO File (DVD). Because unlike before, where you get an installation disc and a product key for Windows, computers these days come with a digital license.

There are third-party applications that offer similar, if not entirely, the same functions when creating an installation media. Still, before searching all over the internet, you should give the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool a try.

In this article, you will learn how to create a bootable USB flash drive or an ISO File (DVD). The resulting media can then be used to reinstall your computer's Windows 10 operating system.

## Requirements

Here are the things you will need to follow along:

- A Windows 10 computer of any version should work.
- You must have administrator permissions on the local computer.
- A stable internet connection.
- A USB flash drive with at least 8 GB storage capacity or a Blank Disc (DVD). It is recommended to use a blank flash drive or DVD because the contents will be deleted during the process.

## Media Creation Tool

The Media Creation Tool lets you create a copy of the Windows operating system. This tool currently supports Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1, and Windows 10.

You can use two methods to create an installation media; via *USB Flash Drive* or *ISO File (DVD)*. The most commonly used way is the USB Flash Drive since you will just need to plug it in, unlike with the ISO File (DVD) that requires a CD/DVD drive where you can insert the disc. But it's still up to you which method you would prefer.

### Downloading the Media Creation Tool

The first thing that you will need is to download the [Media Creation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10). When you get to the website, click on the **Download tool now** button. After that, you can proceed with creating your Windows 10 installation media.

#### Creating an Installation Media

### Choosing which Media to use

Two methods were mentioned in the prior sections of the article, and here is where you need to choose which one to use. With the **USB Flash Drive** option, Windows 10 will be set up on your flash drive directly. In contrast, with the **ISO file** option, you will need to burn it to a DVD to use it to install Windows 10 on your computer. After selecting which media you want to use, click **Next.**
